This is a project prototype for the Myntra Hacker-Ramp _We for She_ 2024. 

**Problem Statement**
Building engagement constructs on a platform which will drive a connect and virality among younger audiences in the country. It need not be linked to shopping but needs to be linked to fashion, which will drive users to keep visiting the app on a habitual basis.

**Solution**
**_Gamification_**
We aimed to create a solution which would enagage as many users and customers as possible by introfucing gamification elements such as try-on hauls, quizzes and constests, live streamings, streaks as badges/coins. 

**Technology**
1. _Frontend_: HTML/CSS and JavaScript
2. _Backend_: JavaScript libraries such as three.js, etc.
3. _Database_: MySQL
4. _Deployement_: GitHub
